## Installation

**Rasa Quick Installation**

You can install Rasa Open Source using pip. It is strongly recommended to create a virtual environment.

```bash
$ pip3 install rasa
```

For full installation guide, check out the [Rasa Documentation](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/).

## Running locally
The bot can be run on Terminal locally. The bot calls the action server via the url specified under endpoints.yml.

**1. Run Rasa Shell**
In a Terminal tab in your bot directory,  enter this command line to run rasa: 
```bash
rasa shell
```
Alternatively, to see debugging information in Terminal as the program runs, you can append the debug property:
```bash
rasa shell --debug
```

**2. Run Action Server**
Running the action server is necessary to utilise the custom actions writtten in actions.py.
To run the action server, open up another tab in Terminal and enter this command line:
```bash
rasa run actions 
```


Response:
```bash
[{
	"recipient_id": "Pradeep",
	"text": "Good to see you! below are quick links for you",
	"buttons": [{
		"title": "Shop By Categories",
		"payload": "\/action_categories_list"
	}, {
		"title": "Show Products",
		"payload": "\/action_customer_product"
	}, {
		"title": "Contact Us",
